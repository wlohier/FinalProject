### second semester Diner Dash final project by team MeMyselfAndI (William Lohier)

###Basic Description
OKUUUUUURT this is Diner Dash! it's a little bit retro but that adds to the charm :) basically your goal is to make as much shmoney in as little time as possible. You do that by running around and serving all the customers that walk into your store. There are multiple steps you need to accomplish in order to serve a customer, get paid, and clear the table. Each customer leaves a tip depending on how fast the service was. Once you earn a certain amount in tips, you win!

###Instructions:
How to run:
run the following in a bash shell
~~~~~~~
$ DinerDash.pde
~~~~~~~

How to navigate and use:

	1. You start off with a new game. You can pause to see the backstory.
	
	2. after a few moments, the first customer will appear. click and drag that customer
	to the table you want to seat them at.
	
	3. once a customer is seated at a table, click on the table to take the customer's order.
	
	4. once you have the customer's order, click on the counter (the large block at the top)
	to place the order into the kitchen. Wait a few moments until it appears on the counter.
	
	5. Click on the counter again to pick up the food and return with it to the customer's table. 
	the customer will automatically begin eating it and finish in a few moments.
	
	6. Once the food says "finished!" click the customer's table and GET THAT SHMONEYYY. 
	clear the table by bringing the food to the dumpster.
	
	7. Repeat for each customer until you have enough shmoney
	to take a vacation from the evils of capitalism.
	
	notes:
		-You can moniter how quickly the food will be eaten by its color. It turns red as it is eaten.
